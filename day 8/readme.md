TASK 1: TUPLE METHODS

 Create a tuple first and perform the following methods.

  Q)1 find the length of the tuple.

  hint: The len function returns number of elements in the tuple.

  Q2) Write a python program to concatenate to tuples together.

  HINT: The (+) can be used to concatenate two tuples.

  Q3) Write the python program to count the occurance of an element in the tuple.

  Hint: The count() returns the number of occurances of a given value in the tuple.

  example: tuple=[2,5,6,7,6,6]

  output must be 3.   (Here 6 occures three times in the tuple)

  Q4)  Write the python program to find the index of an element in the tuple.

  HINT: The index() returns the index of first occurance of the given value in the tuple.

  Q5)  Write the python program to iterate through a tuple using a loop .

  HINT: A for loop can be used to iterate through the element of the tuple.
