CREATE A SET AND PERFORM THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS.

Question 1: Write a Python program to create an empty set.
  
 example: 

my_set = set() 
  
Question 2: Write a Python program to create a set using elements "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
  
example:

fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} 

Question 3: Write a Python program to find the length of a set.

example:

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

length = len(my_set)
  
print(length)
  
Question 4: Write a Python program to add an element to a set.

example:

my_set.add(6) 
  
Question 5: Write a Python program to remove an element from a set.

  example:

my_set.remove(3)  
  
Question 6: Write a Python program to check if the element is present in a set.

example:
  
Question 7: Write a Python program to perform set union.

example:
  
set1 = {1, 2, 3}

set2 = {3, 4, 5}

union_set = set1.union(set2) 
  
Question 8: Write a Python program to perform set intersection.

example:

intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2) 
  
Question 9: Write a Python program to perform set difference.

  example:

difference_set = set1.difference(set2) 

   
Question 10: Write a Python program to clear all elements from a set.

  example:

my_set.clear()
