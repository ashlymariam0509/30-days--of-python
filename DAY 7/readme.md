TASK 1: Print the following pattern

QN1 Write a Python code to print the following number pattern using a loop.

1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5

  TASK 2: Calculate sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
  
 QN2 Write a Python program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number

For example, if the user entered 10, the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

Expected Output:

Enter number 10
Sum is:  55
HINT:

Accept input from user in Python
Calculate sum and average in Python

TASK 3: Display numbers from a list using a loop.

QN 3 Write a Python program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions.

The number must be divisible by five.

If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the following number

If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
Given:

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Expected output:

75
150
145


TASK 4: Count the total number of digits in a number.

QN4 Write a Python program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.

For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.


TASK 5: Print list in reverse order using a loop.
Given:

list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Expected output:

50
40
30
20
10
